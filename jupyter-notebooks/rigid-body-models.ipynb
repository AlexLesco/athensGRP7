    "This sub-project has as goal to develop rigid body models for vibrating doors in driving busses. In this project we assume the door to have physical dimensions such as a length, width and thickness. This is in contrast with point mass systems developed before. We thus assume the door to be a rigid bar (with a given cross-sectional aria), an interconnection of rigid bars, a (thin) plate or an interconnection of rigid bars. The door is assumed to be attached to the bus via joints. The (components of the) door are assumed to undergo a rigid body motion (translation and rotation) without deforming.    \n",

    "As before, we aim at: \n",
    "1. static analysis to estimate e.g. maximum displacement given a load); \n",
    "2. transient analysis to follow orbit of point mass(es) in time; \n",
    "3. eigenmode analysis to estimate dominant modes of the system; \n",
    "4. vivrational analysis subject to stochastic load;\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make use of [RigidBodyDynamics.jl](https://juliarobotics.org/RigidBodyDynamics.jl/stable/) by adapting e.g. the double pendulum example. More documentation (time integration of stiff systems of ordinary differential equations that describe the orbit of the mechanism) is provided in [paper on multibody dynamics](https://juliacon.github.io/proceedings-papers/jcon.00043/10.21105.jcon.00043.pdf).
