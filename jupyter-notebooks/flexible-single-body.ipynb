    "# Flexible Single Body Models (no rigid displacements)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to consider flexible single body models. We assume the door to be a flexible bar (or plate) attached to the bus. We wish to take the structural properties of the door (deformation, strain and stress) into account. We assume (for simplicity) that the door is a linear (small displacement around point of equilibrium in which the door is closed) and homogeneous (constant Lame parameters or Youngs' modulus) elastic medium. We wish to compare e.g. a rigid door and flexible suspension (expect large rigid displacement of the door, recover previous cases) with a flexible door and stiff suspension (expect large deformation of the door, recover case of flexible bar attached to reference). \n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we aim at\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a static analysis: one is typically interested in maximal displacements, accelarations and stresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. a transient (or vibration) analysis: one is interested in the motion of the bar or plate. In a transient analysis, some form of the wave-equation needs to be solved (vibrasting plate theory). Discretization is space can be performed using a finite difference or finite element method. Time-integration can be performed using DifferentialEquations.jl (or alternatives). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. an eigenmode analysis: one is interested in the shape modes of the system and the associated eigenfrequencies of the dynamical system. These eigenmodes can be used to  construct a reduced order model of the system. Such a reduced order model of model will facilitate modeling the impact of random excitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. a random vibration analysis: one is interested in the response of a system due to a statistically varrying load; "
